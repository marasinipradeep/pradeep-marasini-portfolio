                    <p class="col-md-8" role="definition"> Hello everyone "Namaste". My name is Pradeep Marasini.I was born and rasied in Nepal also known for country of Himalayas where mount Everest is located. From my childhood, I was more facinated towards different Engineering technologies speciallly Electonics, Telicommunicaton and Computer System. I was always curious to know about how the things works behind the seen. Therefore, when I grew up I decided to gain valuable insight knowledge by joining the course in Electronics and Communication Engineering. After, the completion of my course I was able to transfer my skills on solving the real life problems. So I joined small firm which was focused on delivering the banking solutions.
                    <br/>
                    I worked at a medium-sized enterprise in IT (Information Technology) company. My tasks included the development of application programs for business processes as well as working on  projects from the initial development of the project to final testing of the software.
                    <br/>
                    International experience for graduates is becoming more and more important. Thus, I decided to travel abroad to become acquainted with a new country and culture. I have chosen to come to Australia to learn more about the diversity of people, practice my English and travel around.</p>
